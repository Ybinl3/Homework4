### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Setting up the RecyclerView and Adapater was a challenging concept to implement as well as keeping
the app consistent during orientation change. Another challenge was displaying the ratings/popularity/date for
the NOW PLAYING movies and adjusting the adapter to achieve this UI improvement.
